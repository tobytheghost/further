# Refund Request Approval App

Hi Further! 👋

This is my submission for the Refund Request Approval App. I've included a few notes below to help you get started.

A live preview can be found here: https://further-orpin.vercel.app/

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

To run the app in development mode, run `npm run dev`.

Any problems, please let me know!

## Request

An investor may receive a refund on their investment into a fund based on specific time limits, which vary depending on whether the requester had signed up to the old or new Terms of Service (TOS) and whether the reversal request was submitted via the phone or on the web-app.

| Request Type | Approval time limit for old TOS | Approval time limit for new TOS |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| On the phone | 4 hours after investment        | 8 hours after investment        |
| Web app      | 8 hours after investment        | 16 hours after investment       |

**Note**: US customers follow the date format MONTH/DAY/YEAR, whereas Europeans use DAY/MONTH/YEAR. An investor is subject to the new TOS if they signed up after 1/2/2020 for US customers and after the equivalent date of 2/1/2020 for Europeans.

The table below gives you a list of customers' reversal requests.

Write a small front end application that will take in the data in the table above and display whether each refund request should be approved or denied. The emphasis of the application should be on solving the problem, and much less on the architecture, design, etc.
